Useful tool for static responses. It's like Fiddler's AutoResponder.

-   Simple UI to manage Rules and Responses
-   Farx & Saz import
-   JSON files or boltdb for rules and responses storage

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/asalih/http-auto-responder

## ToDo

-   Farx import (inprogress)
-   Use templating and project a model to response
-   How can we use SSL? or should we?
